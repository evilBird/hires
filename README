Python version of the HiRes Maximum Correlation Method algorithm.

Licensed under a 3-clause BSD style license - see LICENSE.txt

HiRes is a superresolution method, published by H.H. Aumann, J.W. Fowler,
and M. Melnyk, 1990, The Astronomical Journal, Volume 99, Number 5, with
title "A Maximum Correlation Method for Image Construction of IRAS
Survey Data".

The algorithm has been in use at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center
(IPAC) at Caltech for many years, for enhancing the resolution of IRAS data.
The method was developed to handle variable beam profiles.
In the limiting case of a constant beam response, the algorithm performs
a Lucy-Richardson deconvolution in the image domain.

The Python version was coded by Robert Narron at IPAC to work on Planck
time-ordered data. Extension to SPIRE timeline data was made by Robert
Narron and David Shupe.
